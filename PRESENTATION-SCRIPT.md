## Opening (30 seconds)
"Good [morning/afternoon]. I'm [Name], and I'm here to show you EZTeach—a single app that brings your school, teachers, parents, and substitutes together in one place. No more juggling multiple tools. One platform. One login. Everything connected."

---

## The Problem (45 seconds)
"Schools today use spreadsheets for grades, paper for attendance, email for parents, and phone calls for subs. Nothing talks to each other. Teachers spend time on admin instead of teaching. Parents don't know where to look for information. And finding a good sub? It's a gamble. EZTeach fixes that."

---

## Versatility (1 minute)
**"We are versatile—and that matters."**

"EZTeach works for K–12. Public schools. Private schools. Single schools. Districts. We don't force you into a box. You tell us your structure—we adapt. One school or fifty. Teachers, subs, parents—everyone gets the right view. No extra modules. No hidden fees. One subscription covers your school. Districts can pay for multiple schools in one go—no double billing, no confusion."

## Core Features (2–3 minutes)

**Grades & Attendance**
"Grades and attendance live in one place. Teachers enter points, fractions, or letter grades. Auto-calculation, weighted categories, overrides when needed. Parents see only their child—nothing else. Secure. FERPA-aware."

**Calendar & Announcements**
"School-wide calendar. Events. Announcements. Filter what teachers see vs. everyone else. School info and office info visible to all—editable only by you. One homepage. One source of truth."

**Substitute Management**
"This is where we stand out. Book subs. Track who's available. And here's what no one else does: **Sub Ranking**. Schools rate substitutes. Top 100 by city. Compliments and complaints—tagged with your school name. When you search for a sub, you see who other schools trust. Districts see rankings across all their schools."

**Parent Integration**
"Parents get a portal. Grades, attendance, messages—tied to their child via a secure student code. No access to other students. No clutter. Full transparency for families, zero extra work for you."

**Funday Friday**
"Every Friday we spin to pick a winning school—then we choose 6 rewards for them. Confetti, fireworks, and a personal touch. Our way of saying thank you. No other platform does this."

## Handling Objections

**"We already use X."**  
"EZTeach can complement or replace. We bring grades, attendance, subs, parents, and communication into one place. If you're happy with one piece, keep it—but many schools find they can consolidate and save time."

**"What about training?"**  
"Simple interface. Teachers pick it up fast. We have support, and we can do a quick walkthrough for your staff."

**"What about data migration?"**  
"We can discuss options. Many schools start fresh for the new term. We're flexible."

**"How do parents sign up?"**  
"They download the app, create an account, and pick their child's school by name or city. Then they enter the student code the school provides. Secure. Simple."

# EZTeach — Talking Tips & Counters to Questions

## Talking Tips
- **Pause after key points** — Let "Sub Ranking" and "Funday Friday" land.
- **Make eye contact** — Especially when saying "versatile" and "secure."
- **Speak slowly on numbers** — "$75 per month" clearly.
- **Use their school name** — "At [School Name], you could..."
- **End with a clear CTA** — "Download the app. Create an account. We're here to help."

## Counters to Common Questions

### "We already use [PowerSchool / Google Classroom / etc.]"
**Counter:** "EZTeach can complement what you have. Many schools use us for subs and parent communication while keeping their SIS for reporting. Or they consolidate. We're flexible—you tell us what you need."

---

### "What about training?"
**Counter:** "The interface is straightforward. Most teachers are up and running in minutes. We offer support and can do a quick walkthrough for your staff. No lengthy onboarding."

---

### "What about data migration?"
**Counter:** "Many schools start fresh for a new term—cleaner. If you have specific migration needs, we can discuss options. We're willing to work with you."

---

### "How do parents sign up?"
**Counter:** "Parents download the app, create an account, and select their child's school by name or city. Then they enter the student code the school provides. Secure. Simple. No extra work for you."

---

### "Is it FERPA compliant?"
**Counter:** "We're FERPA-conscious. Data is encrypted, US-hosted, and role-based. Parents see only their child. Schools see only their data. We don't sell data. We take student privacy seriously."

---

### "What if we outgrow it?"
**Counter:** "We scale with you. Single school or district. We're constantly updating—new features, security, improvements. You're not locked into a static product."

---

### "Why should we choose EZTeach over others?"
**Counter:** "Three things: **Versatility**—K–12, districts, private. **Sub Ranking**—no other platform lets schools rank subs by school and city. **Funday Friday**—we celebrate our schools every week. Plus constant updates and a team that listens."

---

### "What about support?"
**Counter:** "We have in-app support. You can submit claims. We respond. And we're building this for schools—we want feedback. You're not just a ticket number."

---

### "Can we try before we buy?"
**Counter:** "Yes. Create an account. Use the trial. Add a few teachers, a few students. See how it feels. Promo codes are available for pilots."

         HANDLING COMMON OBJECTIONS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

OBJECTION: "We already have systems in place."
RESPONSE: "That's exactly why schools love EZTeach — it
replaces all of them. One app, one login, one bill. Your
teachers stop juggling 5+ platforms and actually use
everything. We've seen adoption rates go from 30% to 90%
because everything is in one place."

OBJECTION: "Our teachers won't want to learn something new."
RESPONSE: "EZTeach is designed to be simpler than what they
already use. If they can use their phone, they can use
EZTeach. And because everything is in one app, there's
actually less to learn — not more."

OBJECTION: "$129/month feels like a lot."
RESPONSE: "How much are you paying for attendance software
right now? Grades? Messaging? Videos? Most schools pay
$15,000+ per year across all these tools. EZTeach starts at
$129/month — that's $1,548/year. You'd save over $13K
annually, and get more features."

OBJECTION: "What about data privacy / FERPA?"
RESPONSE: "All data is encrypted in transit and at rest using
Firebase/Google Cloud. We're FERPA compliant. Student data
stays private. We never sell data. Full privacy policy at
ezteach.org/privacy."

OBJECTION: "Can we try it first?"
RESPONSE: "Schools can create an account and explore the full
platform. We offer the first 25 schools 25% off their first
month or first year — their choice. It's risk-free."

OBJECTION: "What if we outgrow the Starter plan?"
RESPONSE: "You can upgrade your tier anytime. Growth supports
up to 1,000 students, School up to 7,500. Districts get
custom plans with per-school tier selection. You'll never
outgrow EZTeach."

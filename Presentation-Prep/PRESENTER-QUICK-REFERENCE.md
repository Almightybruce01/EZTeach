## Objection Handlers

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We already use Google Classroom" | "Google Classroom does assignments. EZTeach does assignments PLUS grades, AI lesson plans, 100+ books, games, behavior tracking, and multiplayer reading. One app instead of five." |
| "Teachers don't want another app" | "That's exactly the point — EZTeach REPLACES apps, it doesn't add another one. Less logins, not more." |
| "Is the AI really useful?" | "Our AI generates complete lesson plans with 5 objective levels, 4 activity types, differentiation strategies, and mapped standards. Teachers save 3-5 hours per week." |
| "What about data privacy?" | "We're FERPA and COPPA compliant with role-based access control and school-scoped data isolation. Student data is never shared outside the school." |
| "Our budget is tight" | "EZTeach replaces multiple subscriptions. At $4.99/teacher/month, it's cheaper than most single-feature tools. And students/parents are always free." |
| "We need Android too" | "Android is on our roadmap. Currently iOS-first, but web access is planned as well." |

# EZTeach Presentation — Talking Tips & Script

> Ready-to-present guide. Each slide has key talking points, timing, and delivery tips.
> **Total time: ~20-25 minutes + Q&A**

---

## SLIDE 1: Title (1 minute)

**What to say:**
> "Good morning/afternoon everyone. My name is [Name] and I'm excited to introduce you to EZTeach — the future of learning, all in one app. Today I'm going to show you how one platform can replace the 8-12 different tools most schools are currently paying for and struggling to manage."

**Tip:** Start with energy. Make eye contact. Pause after "all in one app" for effect.

---

## SLIDE 2: The Problem (2 minutes)

**What to say:**
> "Let me ask you a question — how many different apps does your school use right now? Grading in one system, attendance in another, behavior tracking somewhere else, parent communication through email, learning games on yet another platform...
>
> Teachers are spending hours every week just switching between tools. Districts are spending thousands on subscriptions that don't even talk to each other. Parents feel disconnected — they have to check 3 different apps just to know if their kid turned in homework. And students? They're growing up with TikTok and Roblox — they need learning tools that actually engage them."

**Tip:** Pause after each pain point. Let the audience nod in agreement. They LIVE these problems.

---

## SLIDE 3: The Solution (2 minutes)

**What to say:**
> "EZTeach solves all of this with ONE app. One login. One place for teachers, students, parents, schools, and districts. It covers K through 12 plus electives. Let me show you what that looks like.
>
> Teachers get a complete toolkit — AI-powered lesson planning, gradebook, attendance, behavior tracking, and parent communication. Students get something no other education app offers — a full library of 100+ picture books, educational games with leaderboards, and a first-of-its-kind multiplayer reading experience called 'Reading Together.'"

**Tip:** Emphasize "ONE app" — hold up one finger. This is your key differentiator.

---

## SLIDE 4: AI Features (3 minutes)

**What to say:**
> "Let's talk about what makes EZTeach truly different — our AI. This isn't just a buzzword. Our AI Lesson Plan Generator saves teachers HOURS of planning time every single week.
>
> Here's how it works: A teacher selects their subject — let's say Math. They pick the grade level, type in their topic like 'Fractions,' choose a learning style focus, and hit generate. In seconds, the AI creates a complete, standards-aligned lesson plan with five Bloom's Taxonomy objectives, four different activity types, differentiation strategies for five levels of learners, CCSS standards mapped, assessment methods, and homework.
>
> And here's the best part — the AI gets smarter with every use. It learns from your school's patterns, what works, what teachers keep versus what they modify, and produces better plans over time."

**Tip:** This is your WOW moment. Slow down when listing the AI capabilities. If you have a device, consider doing a live demo here.

## SLIDE 5: Reading Together (3 minutes) — HIGHLIGHT THIS

**What to say:**
> "Now I want to highlight something truly unique — our Reading Together feature. This is the FIRST multiplayer reading experience in an education app. Think of it like a virtual reading circle.
>
> A teacher or student picks a book from our library, creates a session, and gets a join code. Classmates enter that code and suddenly everyone is reading the same book, on the same page, in real-time. You can see who's in the session with a live participant bar.
>
> Why does this matter? Research shows that shared reading builds fluency faster than solo reading. It creates social accountability — kids read more when their friends are watching. It's perfect for ESL students who benefit from hearing others read. And it works for remote learning too — students can do reading circles from home.
>
> No other education platform has this. This is exclusive to EZTeach."

**Tip:** This is your EXCLUSIVE feature. Say "first" and "exclusive" with emphasis. This is what makes you different from Google Classroom, ClassDojo, and Seesaw.

---

## SLIDE 6: Games & Activities (2 minutes)

**What to say:**
> "Students today are digital natives. They need learning that feels like playing. Our game section includes math challenges, reading adventures with interactive books, science explorations, and a full electives hub for Art, Music, Dance, Band, and P.E.
>
> The leaderboards show real student names — not 'Player 1' or anonymous IDs. This creates healthy competition and real motivation. And the electives? They're structured as step-by-step learning activities with no scoring pressure — because art and music should be about exploration, not competition."

**Tip:** If you have a device, show a quick game screenshot here. Kids and parents LOVE this section.

---

## SLIDE 7: Teacher Portal (2 minutes)

**What to say:**
> "For teachers, EZTeach is a complete command center. Grades for every subject K-12 plus Electives. One-tap attendance. Behavior tracking with write-ups that can be shared with parents and admin. Customizable bell schedules. School announcements. Document sharing. And homework with photo upload — students can photograph their work and submit it right from the app."

**Tip:** Tick off features on your fingers. The goal is to show VOLUME — how much is packed into one app.

---

## SLIDE 8: Parent Portal (1.5 minutes)

**What to say:**
> "Parents are partners in education, but most schools accidentally shut them out. With EZTeach, parents see real-time grades — no waiting for report cards. They see homework assignments and whether they've been turned in. They get instant behavior notifications. They can see which books their child is reading and how they're performing in games.
>
> Studies show parent involvement increases student achievement by up to 30%. EZTeach makes involvement effortless."

**Tip:** The 30% statistic is a strong closer for this slide. Pause and let it land.

---

## SLIDE 9: School & District Management (1.5 minutes)

**What to say:**
> "For administrators, EZTeach provides full account management. You can add and remove students, teachers, and staff. You can filter students by grade level — Pre-K through 12th grade plus Elective — to quickly find who you're looking for. Search by name or student code. And everything is secured with role-based access control and FERPA/COPPA compliance.
>
> At the district level, you manage multiple schools from one dashboard with aggregate analytics and unified billing."

**Tip:** Mention FERPA/COPPA compliance — this is a deal-breaker for many decision-makers.

---

## SLIDE 10: Picture Books (1.5 minutes)

**What to say:**
> "Our library includes over 100 curated children's picture books from beloved authors — Dr. Seuss, Eric Carle, Pete the Cat, and many more. Each book features rich scene illustrations with contextual backgrounds, mood particles, and read-aloud narration.
>
> Plus, students can access thousands of free public domain classics from the Gutenberg library. That's a built-in library bigger than most school libraries — accessible from any device."

**Tip:** The "bigger than most school libraries" line usually gets a reaction. Use it.

---

## SLIDE 11: Pricing (1 minute)

**What to say:**
> "Our pricing is simple and affordable. Individual teachers pay just $4.99 per month. School plans are $49.99 per month for unlimited teachers. District pricing is custom based on the number of schools.
>
> And here's what's important — students and parents access the app for FREE through their school. There's no paywall blocking a child from learning."

**Tip:** Emphasize "FREE for students." This removes objections about equity.

---

## SLIDE 12: Competitive Advantage (1.5 minutes)

**What to say:**
> "Let me show you how we stack up. Google Classroom does assignments but has no gradebook, no games, no books. ClassDojo tracks behavior but can't grade or plan lessons. Seesaw is great for sharing but has no AI, no reading library, no multiplayer features.
>
> EZTeach has ALL of these — and more — in one app. That's not marketing speak, that's the feature comparison right there on the screen."

**Tip:** Point to the comparison table. Let the checkmarks speak for themselves.

---

## SLIDE 13: Complete Feature List (1 minute)

**What to say:**
> "Here's the full picture — three columns, dozens of features. Teaching tools, student experience, and admin/parent capabilities. I encourage you to look through this and find ANYTHING missing. We've built the most comprehensive education platform available."

**Tip:** Don't read the whole list. Let them scan it visually while you make the "most comprehensive" claim.

---

## SLIDE 14: Vision (1.5 minutes)

**What to say:**
> "We're just getting started. Coming soon: built-in video meetings, Android support, multi-language translations, and AI that learns specifically from YOUR school's data to provide increasingly personalized recommendations.
>
> Our mission is simple: every child deserves engaging modern learning tools. Every teacher deserves technology that saves time. Every parent deserves transparency. EZTeach makes all of this possible."

**Tip:** The mission statement should feel personal and genuine. Slow down here.

---

## SLIDE 15: Call to Action (1 minute)

**What to say:**
> "EZTeach is available now on the App Store. Students access it for free through their school. We'd love to set up a pilot program with your school or district.
>
> Let's transform education together. Thank you — I'd be happy to take any questions."

**Tip:** End with confidence. Smile. Open for Q&A.

---

## COMMON Q&A ANSWERS

**Q: Is this FERPA compliant?**
> A: Yes. We use role-based access control, school-scoped data isolation, and follow FERPA/COPPA guidelines. Student data is never shared outside the school.

**Q: What about students without devices?**
> A: EZTeach runs on any iOS device including school iPads. We're also building an Android version and web access.

**Q: How does the AI compare to ChatGPT?**
> A: Our AI is purpose-built for education. It understands Common Core standards, Bloom's Taxonomy, and differentiation strategies. It doesn't just generate text — it generates complete, usable lesson plans.

**Q: Can parents opt out?**
> A: Parent accounts are optional. Schools control what data is visible. Parents only see their own child's information.

**Q: What about the free books — are these legal?**
> A: The classics library uses public domain texts from Project Gutenberg. Our picture book content is original, inspired by classic themes while respecting copyright.

**Q: How is this different from what we already use?**

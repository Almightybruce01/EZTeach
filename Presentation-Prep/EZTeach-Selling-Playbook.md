## 1. Before the Meeting

### Know Your Audience

| Who | What They Care About | Lead With |
|---|---|---|
| Principal | Student outcomes, teacher retention | AI lesson plans, parent portal, games |
| District Admin | Compliance, cost savings, scalability | Standards system, pricing, analytics |
| Tech Director | Security, integration, FERPA | Single platform, Firebase security |
| Teacher | Time savings, ease of use | AI lesson plans, one-login simplicity |
| School Board | Budget, community impact | Cost comparison, Weekly School Pick |

### Research the School

- Look up their state standards (TEKS, B.E.S.T., CCSS, etc.)
- Check student count (determines pricing tier)
- Find out what tools they currently use
- Look for pain points

Pro tip: Ask the front office one question: "How many different software platforms do your teachers log into each day?" The answer is usually 5-8. That is your opening.

## 2. The Opening (First 2 Minutes)

"I want to ask you a question. How many different apps and platforms do your teachers use on a daily basis? ... Right. And how many of those do parents actually use? ... That is the problem we solve.

EZTeach is one app that replaces all of them -- attendance, grades, messaging, lesson plans, videos, books, games, video meetings, analytics -- everything. One login. One platform."

Do NOT jump straight into features. Start with their pain.

## 3. The Demo Flow (10-15 Minutes)

### Step 1: AI Lesson Plans (3 min)
"I type in 5th grade, Math, Fractions... and in 10 seconds, the AI generates a full lesson plan aligned to your state standards. Activities. Assessments. Differentiation. Teachers used to spend 2 hours. Now it takes 2 minutes."

### Step 2: Standards System (2 min)
"We have your state's exact standards built in. If your district has custom standards or your school wants overrides, you can do that. The AI automatically uses whatever is active."

### Step 3: Movies and Free Books (2 min)
"Over 120 educational movies built in. No YouTube. No ads. Plus thousands of free books. 100+ picture books with read-aloud. And a full school library system."

### Step 4: AI Tutoring for Parents (2 min)
"Parents don't just see grades -- the AI creates personalized study plans they can follow at home. We don't just inform parents. We empower them."

### Step 5: Games and Leaderboards (1 min)
"20+ educational games. Kids can see the top 100 students at their school or switch to worldwide. Engagement goes through the roof."

### Step 6: Weekly School Pick (1 min)
"Every week, we select one EZTeach school to receive gifts -- school supplies, gift cards, classroom prizes."

## 4. Handling Objections

"We already use Google Classroom."
- Google Classroom does assignments. It does not do lesson plans, video meetings, library management, movies, games, or standards alignment. EZTeach does all of that AND everything Classroom does.

"We don't have budget."
- What are you paying for Remind, Class Dojo, IXL, BrainPOP combined? Our plans start at $129/month with every feature included.

"Our teachers won't learn a new system."
- One app with one login. Teachers learn one system instead of five. AI lesson plans save so much time that adoption happens naturally.

"Is it FERPA compliant?"
- Yes. Firebase security rules for every collection. Student data is never shared.

"We need to see it work first."
- Free 30-day pilot with one grade level. No cost.

"What about special needs?"
- AAC Talker Board -- 200+ emoji cards with text-to-speech, sentence building, teacher-customizable.

"District deal?"
- Yes. Central dashboard, standards overrides, multi-school analytics, volume discounts.

The #1 objection killer: "What if one app replaces all of those -- and costs less than any one of them individually?"

---

## 5. The Close

### Option A: Pilot Close
"Free 30-day pilot with one team. I will help set up and train teachers in 30 minutes."

### Option B: Urgency Close
"First 25 schools get 25% off their first month or entire first year, your choice. Plus Weekly School Pick from day one."

### Option C: Board Close
"Let me prepare a one-page cost comparison. Would it help if I came to the board meeting for a 5-minute demo?"

Always leave behind: The pamphlet, your contact info, and the one-liner.

## Objection Handlers

> "We designed for simplicity. Free onboarding training included. Most teachers are comfortable in 1-2 days."

### "What about data privacy?"
> "Fully COPPA/FERPA compliant. Encrypted data, US servers, we never sell data."

### "Can we import existing data?"
> "Yes! CSV import for students/staff. Most schools complete import in under an hour."

## Slide-by-Slide Script & Tips

---

## SLIDE 1: Title Slide
**Time: 1-2 minutes**

### What to Say:
> "Good [morning/afternoon]! I'm [Name], and I'm here to show you something that I genuinely believe will transform how your school operates.
>
> EZTeach isn't just another school app. It's a complete ecosystem - one app that serves everyone: administrators, teachers, parents, students, substitutes, librarians, even district officials.
>
> Look at these numbers: ONE app, EIGHT user roles, over FIFTY features, and infinite possibilities. By the end of this presentation, you'll understand why schools that switch to EZTeach never look back."

### Tips:
- Project confidence - this is your product
- Make eye contact during "one app" emphasis
- Pause after "never look back" for effect

---

## SLIDE 2: The Problem
**Time: 2-3 minutes**

### What to Say:
> "Let me ask you something: How many different apps, systems, or platforms does your school use right now? [Pause for responses]
>
> I've talked to schools using SEVEN different systems. One for grades, one for communication, one for attendance, one for lunch, one for buses... it's chaos.
>
> On the left, you see the current reality. Multiple disconnected apps that don't talk to each other. Expensive per-feature pricing that adds up fast. Limited parent involvement - they get notifications but can't really participate.
>
> On the right? That's EZTeach. Everything unified. Flat-rate pricing. Real-time everything. Parents who are actually involved in their child's education.
>
> Here's the key difference: Other apps were built to MANAGE schools. EZTeach was built to CONNECT them."

### Tips:
- Get audience participation with the "how many apps" question
- Use hand gestures to contrast left vs right columns
- Emphasize "CONNECT" with passion

### Handle Objection:
**"We're already using [competitor]"**
> "I understand - change is hard. But let me show you what you're missing..."

## SLIDE 3: AI Features (THE BIG ONE)
**Time: 3-4 minutes**

### What to Say:
> "Now let's talk about what sets EZTeach apart from EVERYONE else: Artificial Intelligence built into every corner of the app.
>
> [Point to AI Lesson Plans] Teachers: imagine generating a complete, standards-aligned lesson plan in 30 seconds. Not a template - a fully customized plan with objectives, activities, assessments, and differentiation strategies. That's AI Lesson Plans.
>
> [Point to AI Study Plans] Parents: you can create personalized study schedules for your children. The AI generates milestones, recommends resources, and tracks progress. This is the kind of involvement parents have been begging for.
>
> [Point to AI Story Books] Our reading library includes AI-generated stories with complete plots, characters, and educational themes. 8-12 pages each, reading level appropriate, with engaging content.
>
> [Point to OCR] Take a picture of any book page, and our OCR technology extracts the text, making it searchable and accessible.
>
> This isn't AI for AI's sake. This is AI that saves teachers HOURS every week and makes learning PERSONALIZED for every student."

### Tips:
- This is your WOW slide - let the audience feel the excitement
- Slow down on the AI Lesson Plans demo - it's your best feature
- Use numbers: "30 seconds", "8-12 pages", "HOURS every week"

### Demo Opportunity:
If possible, do a LIVE demo of generating a lesson plan!

## SLIDE 5: Learning & Engagement
**Time: 3 minutes**

### What to Say:
> "Let me tell you about something that makes me proud. In EZTeach, learning is actually FUN.
>
> We have educational games that kids WANT to play. Math games with unique UIs - a racing game where you answer questions to boost your car, a fraction game with pizza slices, geometry with shapes you can manipulate.
>
> Our free books library has hundreds of public domain classics plus AI-generated stories. Full-page immersive reading with page-flip animations - it feels like a real book.
>
> We have a complete electives hub - art projects, music lessons, cooking recipes, science experiments. Each one is step-by-step with materials lists.
>
> Gym teachers: we have a full library of PE games with complete rules, setup instructions, safety tips, and variations. From Freeze Tag to Kickball to parachute games.
>
> And here's what parents love most: Active Time Tracking. Not screen time - ACTIVE time. We track when students are actually engaging, not just staring at the screen. Parents can see exactly how much real learning is happening."

### Tips:
- Kids loving the games is a SELLING POINT for parents

## SLIDE 6: Homework Revolution
**Time: 2-3 minutes**

### What to Say:
> "Raise your hand if you've ever heard 'I lost my homework' or 'I forgot it at home.' [Wait for hands]
>
> We solved that problem. With EZTeach, students and parents can take a PHOTO of completed homework and submit it instantly.
>
> Here's how it works:
> - Student finishes homework at home
> - Opens EZTeach, goes to assignments
> - Snaps a photo of the completed work
> - Adds a note if needed
> - Hits submit
>
> Done. The homework is now safely in the cloud. Can't be lost, can't be forgotten, can't be eaten by the dog.
>
> And parents can do this TOO. If little Johnny finishes his homework on Sunday night, mom can submit it right then. No waiting until Monday morning.
>
> Teachers see all submissions in real-time. They can grade, provide feedback, and track who's submitted and who hasn't."

### Tips:
- The "raise your hand" engagement gets people involved
- "Eaten by the dog" gets a laugh - use it!
- Emphasize the PARENT submission feature - it's unique

## SLIDE 7: Accessibility
**Time: 2 minutes**

### What to Say:
> "I want to talk about something close to my heart: making sure EVERY student can use EZTeach.
>
> Our AAC Talker Board is designed for students with communication needs. It's a grid of photos with words underneath. Tap the picture, and it speaks the word.
>
> But here's what makes it special: teachers can completely customize it. Add new cards, change colors, rearrange the grid, create student-specific boards. And students can build sentences by tapping multiple cards.
>
> All our books support text-to-speech. Adjustable text sizes. The entire app is designed with accessibility in mind.
>
> Every student deserves access to great education technology. Not just the ones without learning differences."

### Tips:
- Speak from the heart here - this matters
- If you have a personal connection to special needs education, share it briefly
- This feature is a MAJOR differentiator

>
> They can see Active Time metrics - exactly how much real learning time is happening.
>
> They can submit homework on behalf of their children - no more lost assignments.
>
> They can track the school bus in real-time - no more standing at the bus stop wondering.

## SLIDE 11: Comparison
**Time: 2-3 minutes**

### What to Say:
> "Let's be direct about how we compare to competitors.
>
> [Walk through the table]
>
> Only EZTeach has all roles in one app. ClassDojo? Separate apps for parents and teachers. Google Classroom? No parent app at all for younger kids.
>
> Only EZTeach has AI lesson plans. None of the others have this.
>
> Only EZTeach has educational games built in. Others might integrate with third parties, but it's not seamless.
>
> Only EZTeach has an AAC Talker Board for special needs.
>
> Only EZTeach has Active Time tracking.
>
> When you add it all up, no one else offers what we offer."

### Tips:
- Be confident but not arrogant
- Let the checkmarks speak for themselves
- Don't trash competitors - just state facts

## SLIDE 12: Pricing
**Time: 2 minutes**

### What to Say:
> "Now let's talk about what this costs. Our pricing is simple and transparent.
>
> Individual schools: $75 per month. That's it. All features, unlimited users, priority support.
>
> Districts get volume pricing: starting at $60 per school for small districts, down to $30 per school for large districts.
>
> Let me put this in perspective. Many competitors charge $3-5 PER STUDENT PER MONTH. For a school with 300 students, that's $900 to $1,500 per month!
>
> With EZTeach, you pay $75 flat. Same 300 students. That's a savings of over $10,000 per year.
>
> And we don't nickel-and-dime you with add-on features. Everything is included."

### Tips:
- Have the math ready - $75 vs $900+ is powerful
- "Everything is included" addresses the "what's extra" question
- Be ready to discuss district pricing in detail
